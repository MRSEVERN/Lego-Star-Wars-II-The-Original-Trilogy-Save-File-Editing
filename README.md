# Lego-Star-Wars-II-The-Original-Trilogy-Save-File-Editing
This guide aims to explain how to modify a save file for Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy on PC (This also works on Mac save files) and go into details about how the game stores progression. The game writes to the save file in little-endian format. A guide on binary and hex code will be in this document to make it easier to understand how the values in the save file work. This is not intended to cheat as it’s best to have completed the game to know how these values translate in the game. On PC the save files are stored in the directory C:\Users\<Windows Username>\AppData\Local\LucasArts and on Mac it’s in ~/Library/Application Support/LucasArts/. On PC and Mac, the game can have up to 6 save files. The folder names range from savegame_0 to savegame_5 (as required for how many save files exist). In each respective folder contains 2 files CODE.BIN and LSW.BIN. CODE.BIN contains the displayed game completion percentage on the save file load screen which most of the time is correct (unless it hasn’t been updated after modifying the save file). LSW.BIN is the main save file where all the save data is stored.
